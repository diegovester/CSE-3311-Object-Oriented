# CSE-3311-Object-Oriented
Study of an agile unified methodology and its application to object-oriented software development. Topics include requirements acquisition, use case derivation, modeling and design of interaction behavior and state behavior, introduction to design patterns, derivation of design class diagrams, implementation considerations, and deployment.

# Purpose
Content and notes are of a course from the University of Texas at Arlington. My notes are made public for my own convenience as well as current and prospective students.

# Collab
There's no pressure at all for you to help, but if you feel the same way I do, doing stuff together is just more fun. 

I like to utilize markdown for my notes. You probably already know how to use markdown, but [this website is a good reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet).

## Format
Simple is always better, but there's a few patterns I've fallen into over time.

### Professor's Spoken Word
When a professor says something will be on the exam, or otherwise gives off a "vibe" that something is important, I mark the time and add three asterisks ***

Example:

10:05 AM  
Copyleft *** 

If the lecture was recorded, I now have a time stamp to easily go back and listen to. The asterisks provide characters that are easy to find again with Ctrl-F.
